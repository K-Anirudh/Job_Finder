# Job_Finder
Job finding is a strenuous task and some people are not able to get the job they wanted this can be because of lack of information on job vacancies and on the other hand selecting a person who can fulfill the needs of particular role is also a difficult task. 
	To overcome the above mentioned problems to some extent we came up with the project “The Job finder”. The main aim of the project is to connect students and the other people who are looking for jobs with recruiting member of various companies. It has mainly two types of users- applicant and manager(recruiting person). The applicants fill their data such as personal details, skills they have and projects they have done then they can be able to surf through the jobs available and apply for the one in which they interested. The manager of a company can post about job vacancies and can select the applicants of the jobs based on their skill set.
	We have also represented the above data collected as a graph with three types of nodes- Student, Job hopper and Manager and connected them with edges (relations) and able to provide better visualization by writing different graph queries as per the requirement.
